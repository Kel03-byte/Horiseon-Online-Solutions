A website dedicated to "Horiseon", a social media solutions company

Homework Assignment 1

This assignment required me to modify the coding and css on behalf of "Horiseon" to make their website more accesible and the code and styling more efficent and easy to understand.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

I have tidied up the code and css, added alt descriptions to the website images, added a descriptive title to the website and made sure that the relevant links are working as they should be.

Below is a screenshot and the URL of my deployed website
